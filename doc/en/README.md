# Introduction of OpenCV computer vision kit

pcDuino is pin to pin compatible with Arduino so that existing Arduino shields can be installed on pcDuino with a simple translation board (T-board). By being compatible with Arduino ecosystem, pcDuino is a platform that bridges the power of open software linux and the power of open hardware.

Recently, LinkSprite released a powerful mini PC platform pcDuino8 Uno which is powered by Allwinner H8 SoC chip. It has 8 Cortex-A7 ARM cores whose operating frequency is up to 2.0GHz.

Base on this powerful platform, we have constructed a new kit called OpenCV computer vision kit which users can use to quick start OpenCV computer vision and do lost of fun stuff including but not limited to the follows:
* Learn or teach programming
* Learn Ubuntu Linux
* Work with hardware part
* OpenCV computer vision
* Implement a network video monitoring system
* DIY a simple camera
* Motion detection
* Face detection
